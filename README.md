# 💫 About Me

I’m Kamil Stachurski – a MRI Scientist and a Data Scientist  deeply immersed in the intersection of medical imaging and artificial intelligence.

Currently, I’m pursuing my PhD at the **Institute of Nuclear Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences**, where I specialize in **preclinical MRI**, **data modeling** and **image analysis**. My research focuses on different animal models, quantitative DCE/DSC-MRI and machine learning-driven signal interpretation.

🧠 Areas I’m passionate about:
- Preclinical **MRI data analysis**
- **Deep learning** for biomedical imaging
- **Time-series modeling** and parameter mapping
- Translational research and **theranostics**
- **Open science** and reproducible workflows

I combine creativity with scientific rigor — and code with clarity.
